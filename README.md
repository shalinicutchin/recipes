Maya Kaimal's Chicken Kurma 
Ingredients
1/4 cup grated unsweetened coconut
1 1/2 tablespoons raw cashew pieces
1 tablespoon white poppy seeds (optional)
5 tablespoons vegetable oil
1 1/2 cups thinly sliced shallots or onion
2 teaspoons minced garlic
2 teaspoons minced ginger
2 teaspoons finely chopped fresh green chilies (serrano or Thai)
1 cup chopped tomato
3 tablespoons coarsely chopped cilantro leaves, plus more for garnish
Ground masala:
6 teaspoons coriander
1 teaspoon cumin
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne
1/4 teaspoon turmeric
1 teaspoon Garam Masala (see below)
1 1/2 tablespoons salt
2 tablespoons plain yogurt
2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs and breasts, trimmed and cut into 1-inch pieces
Garam Masala:
4 whole pieces star anise
2 teaspoons fennel seeds
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
2 teaspoons ground clove
2 teaspoons ground cardamom
1 teaspoon ground nutmeg
Directions
Ground masala:
In a mini food processor or blender combine the coconut, cashews, poppy seeds, and 1/3 cup water. Grind thoroughly to form a smooth paste like pesto. (A mini processor works best for this.) Set aside.

In a wide deep pan heat 3 tablespoons of the oil over medium-high heat. Fry 1 cup of the shallots until light brown. Stir in the garlic, ginger, green chili, and fry for 1 minute. Add the tomato, 3 tablespoons cilantro, ground masala, Garam Masala, salt, and 1/2 cup water; fry until the tomato breaks down and forms a paste.

Add the yogurt and stir until it dissolves. Add the chicken and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.

Fry the remaining 1/2 cup shallots in the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until very brown and crisp. Remove them to a plate.

Add the coconut and cashew paste to the chicken and simmer for 10 more minutes. Check the salt.

Garam Masala:
Place the star anise in a coffee grinder and grind to a fine powder. Measure out 2 teaspoonfuls, reserving the rest for another use.

Grind the fennel seeds in the coffee grinder to form a fine powder.

Combine all the ingredients and store in an airtight jar away from the light. It will keep for 6 months.
